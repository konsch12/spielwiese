### Population size and structure(s)

Population = group of individuals, at a given time, in defined geographic area

- populations large enough, that individual behaviour does not affect the analysis

- Coleman boat (macro/micro level)

- Meso-level (sub-populations)

Structure of a population = distribution by age, sex, education, etc.

-\> Age pyramid, with multidimensional aspect (education, citizenship)

Austrian pyramid (left):

·      e) is the echo of c)/d): less children born -\> 25 years later less mothers having children

·      d) pill bust

·      c) baby boom

·      b) 2^nd^ world war

·      a) Anschluss (German values of having many children -\> more babies)

### Demography theories
Demographic metabolism = process where certain characteristics of the population are carried up the age pyramid
Demographic dividend = window of opportunity, large birth cohorts economically active
Demographic transition = combination of decreasing fertility and decreasing mortality
::: 


Baby boom (more births) followed by pill bust (less births) -\> contraception was possible






Pure population numbers: Total population, births, deaths, students, working population, pensioners

Demographic processes: fertility, mortality, migration

### Demographic Balancing Equation**

·      Day of year t is important

·      Births -- Deaths -\> natural increase/decrease

·      In -- Out migration -\> net migration

·      Also valid for subpopulations

**Basic Concepts of Demographic Analysis**

Three Riddles:

·      Mortality in Austria vs Mexico: Austria mainly age-related deaths

·      Very high beer consumption in Bamberg

·      Life expectancy decrease since Corona

**Occurrences/exposure rates**

Rate = #occurrences/person-years at risk

Correspondence principle: numerator-denominator match

Population at risk changes over time -\> person-years -\> approximated by average population
